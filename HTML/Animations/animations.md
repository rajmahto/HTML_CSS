# Animations
 

 `animation`: animation-name duration timing-funtion direction iteration delay.

 animation name can be anything but needs to be defined its own keyframes 0% to 100%(duration is percentage)

 duration is the total time animation takes for 1 turn(in seconds).

 timing funtion is same as transition timing functions direction can be normal (0-100-0), alternate-reverse(0-100-0) ,reverse(100-0), alternate(0-100-0)

 iteration is the count of how many times animation to work (infinite also available).
